# MINIPROJECT
The Product we made is basically to provide a learning 
environment that consolidates students programming abilities 
and learn important algorithms by applying it on practical 
problems. This helps making students adept in competitive 
coding as well. The salient features include a convenient editor. 
Conduction of weekly coding competitions and a weekly 
leaderboard that helps in tracking a person’s progress.
Moreover, this project is also intended to provide an assistance 
to faculty in evaluating students programming assignments. 
Basically, it’s a tedious task to evaluate all the assignments of 
students and its hard to see each line of the code written.
